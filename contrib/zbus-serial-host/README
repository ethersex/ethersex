ZBus-Serial-Host uses an serial tty (e.g. /dev/ttyS0) for communicating with
zbus-ip devices. It uses a tun device to emulate an network interface. This 
interface can be treated as any other network interface (e.g. routing, iptables, 
blah, fasel). So you can easily connect your zbus devices with your pc, or any other 
machine with an serial interface (e.g. a linksys with openwrt ).

Hardware
========
RS485 is normaly used to transport zbus-ip packets, so you have to modifiy your serial
interface a little bit. When you have an RS232 interface you will have to use an MAX232 (or similar)
and a rs485 interface chip. An open source rs232 to rs485 interface, which is
compatible with zbus-serial-host can be found here:
