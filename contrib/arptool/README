arpding and sexvertise are tools you might want to use to direct traffic
for RFM12/ZBus devices to your Ethersex bridges.

Think of a large network with multiple Ethersex devices acting as
Ethernet<->ZBus bridges and a large number of ZBus devices that may be
connected to one or the other ZBus line.

The idea is to resolve the IP-address of the ZBus device to the broadcast
MAC address so both bridging Ethersex'es will eventually receive the packet
and forward it in turn.

Mind that this approach doesn't scale very well ^^

``arpding'' is the tool of choice for IPv4/ARP
``sexvetise'' is the advertising tool thought for IPv6 networks

Be careful when using ``sexvertise'', it might cause forwarding loops
(maybe consider using a site-local multicast address instead of broadcasting)
