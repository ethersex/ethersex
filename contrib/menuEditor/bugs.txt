The following bugs are known to appear in the editor:

Images & Text:
  Currently, integrated images or text may not be larger than 66000 pixels/chars.
    This counts for each image/text independent.

Export:
  If the menu uses 24 Bit addresses, occurring errors and warnings are always displayed twice.

Bugs for Linux only:
Also applying to a build app:
  Switching Virtual Desktop minimise the IDE windows 
    http://bugs.freepascal.org/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=12656

Bugs for Mac only:
Export:
  Old Mac versions up to version 9 use '\r' as linebreak, however the export
   function removes '\r' and only uses '\n'. Version 10 uses Unix '\n' line-breaks.

Test:
  Security hole: The 'test' function writes the data to the temporary directory,
    which is readable for all users on the system. (at least for a short moment)
  If the script can't be executed, the application crashes. (Reason is unknown)
  The test only works if there is no global shortcut using the key 254.

Save Files:
  The MenuEdit overwrites existing files without asking. Should ask before overwriting.
