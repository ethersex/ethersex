Core/TTY is a ncurses-like display abstraction layer in Ethersex.

* Key Concepts

** Keep ONE off-screen character image
   This is, every printed character is first written into RAM and
   afterwards synchronized to the display.  This allows for scrolling
   on all kinds of hardware, i.e. even those that don't support from
   hardware side.

** Windows
   Windowing concept quitle like in ncurses, this is one off-screen
   image (associated with the main window) which can be divided into
   sub-windows, which of course shouldn't be overlapping.

   Sub-windows don't have a screen image of their own but share
   (portions of) the "root image"

** API/Functionality
*** printing (of course)
*** cursor movement
*** scrolling

* Possible Extras
** clear to end of line
** clear screen
** save/restore cursor position
   (though not that important with sub-windows)

* Possible output devices
** LCD Character Display (HD44780)
** s1d15g10
** vt100 (serial) terminal
