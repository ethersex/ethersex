Usage of RC5 UDP function
=========================

If you enable the UDP function, you must configure your receiving server in the
submenu. The packets are currently not direct i.e. LIRC compatible - i'm 
working on it. They must be translated for LIRC.
I've done a small php script, which does this job, but it's at the moment not 
release ready. You will find it later (hope in the next days -> Jan 2010) in
contrib/ir directory.

You can choose between 2 different packet types. A binary and a simpler string 
variant. The binary (COUNTER values in the make menu) is nearly like (yes, only 
something like) LIRC.
It starts and ends with 0xff sequence, then it contains the RC5 timer 
counter values on every mark/pause change (Hi->Lo, Lo->Hi).
It's the base for building compatibility with LIRC.
These values needs to be converted for the LIRC UDP driver.

The second one sends a simple string to the configured server.
It's a CSV line (splitted by semicolon) with 3 values and ending newline 
character.

In example:   1;01;02

The first one contains 1 or 0 which stands for the value of the RC5 toggle bit.
The second value is the address number and the last is the command number.

Both UDP packets are send to the Port 6669.
