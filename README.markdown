About Ethersex
==============
Ethersex, originally developed to provide an alternative firmware for the [etherrape hardware](http://www.lochraster.org/etherrape),
evolved into a full-featured still light-weight firmware for the Atmel megaAVR processors.  
For more information and a comprehensive documentation  consult [http://www.ethersex.de](http://www.ethersex.de)!

How to configure the firmware
=============================
Make sure that you meet the requirements.  
Use `make menuconfig` to configure and `make` to compile the firmware.
The final hex file is named `ethersex.hex`.

[See the Quick Start Guide in the wiki for more information](http://ethersex.de/index.php/Quick_Start_Guide)
