This folder should only contain ethersex services. A service is an application
running in the background, usually monitoring or regulary adjusting something or
providing an interface to humans. Typical services are those that provide for
example a domain name service (dns), an e-mail (pop or imap) fetcher, ecmd, ftp
and web access. Services are NOT applications that provide hardware abstraction
or generic functions.
