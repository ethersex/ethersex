 *     |    |       |  |    |                     |

 * short pulse: 20 <= t <= 80
 * long pulse: 90 <= t <= 180
 *
 * Experiments have shown, that the encoding for a logical "0" is a long high
 * pulse, followed by a short low pulse and a logical "1" is a short high
 * pulse, followed by a long low pulse.
 *
 * The datagram is started by sending 8-10 zeroes, followed by a "1".  After
 * that, 16 nibbles (= 4 bit, BCD) of data (LSB first) are sent, divided by
 * exactly one "1".
 *
 * As far as we were able to figure it out for the WS300-2, the meaning is:
 *
 * nibble | meaning
 * ================
 *      1 | constant 1110 (bin, LSB first) == 7 (dec), perhaps sensor type?
 *      2 | 1W0T (bin, LSB first),
 *        | W is set if water is detected, (bit 1)
 *        | T is temperature sign bit (set if temperature is negative (bit 3)
 *      3 | temperature fraction part
 *      4 | temperature decimal place 1
 *      5 | temperature decimal place 10
 *      6 | hygrometer decimal place 1
 *      7 | hygrometer decimal place 10
 *      8 | wind strength fraction part
 *      9 | wind strength decimal place 1
 *     10 | wind strength decimal place 10
 *     11 | rain counter decimal place 1
 *     12 | rain counter decimal place 10
 *     13 | rain counter decimal place 100
 *     14 | unknown, seems to be some sort of checksum?
 *     15 | XOR checksum (XOR every nibble up to and including nibble 15,
 *        | if correct, | the result is zero)
 *     16 | checksum, this is: (sum of nibbles 1 to 15) & 0x0F + 5
 *        | (the lower 4 bit of the sum of the value of all nibbles 1 to 15, plus 5)
 *
 *
 * The datagram is terminated by an additional "1", but this is not always received.
 * A datagram consists of 80 bit, including the last "1".
