This folder should only contain modules that interfere with external hardware or use special abilities of some atmegas like the build-in pwm or usb hardware.
Typical modules are those that allow access to a lcd, to port expanders, to real time clocks or to onewire devices.
What NOT belong to this folder are modules that provide protocols or generic functions. You may argue that your module "use" the atmega hardware, but here's a question you should ask yourself before using the hardware folder: Is your module necessary to access hardware that is not supported by the ethersex core? If the answer is yes, you are probably right here.
