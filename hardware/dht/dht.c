On DHT-11 the 1-wire data bus is pulled up with a resistor to VCC. So
if nothing is occurred the voltage on the bus is equal to VCC.

To make the DHT-11 to send the sensor readings pull down the bus for
more than 18ms in order to give DHT time to understand it and then pull
it up for 40uS.

The response is ~54uS low and 80uS high and indicates that DHT received
the request.

The data will be packed in a packet of 5 segments of 8-bits each. Totally
5Ã—8 =40bits. Each bit sent is a follow of ~54uS Low in the bus and ~24uS
to 70uS High depending on the value of the bit.

Bit '0' : ~54uS Low and ~24uS High
Bit '1' : ~54uS Low and ~70uS High

First two segments are Humidity read, integral & decimal. Following two
are Temperature read in Celsius, integral & decimal and the last segment
is the Check Sum which is the sum of the 4 first segments. If Check Sum's
value isn't the same as the sum of the first 4 segments that means that
data received isn't correct.

At the end of packet DHT sends a ~54uS Low level, pulls the bus to High
and goes to sleep mode.
