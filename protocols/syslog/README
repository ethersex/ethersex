Usage of the syslog module
==========================

there are three cheap possibilities:
  - syslog_send("error: some error"): here the string is copied to an internal
                          buffer. This buffer is dynamically allocated.
  - syslog_sendf_P(PSTR("error: %u"), errornum): here the string "error:" is taken from
                          programspace send through printf and is copied to an internal
                          buffer. This buffer is MAX_DYNAMIC_SYSLOG_BUFFER big (default 100).

All the syslog calls will be queued. Every time the syslog connection is called
one entry from the queue is sent.

All the syslog_* will return 1 on success or 0 on failure
