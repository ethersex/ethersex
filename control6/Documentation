!!! 6Control/Control6
We had to rename 6control into control6, because the C Compiler doesn't like
numbers as the first character of a functionname.

!! What is Control6/6Control?

6Control is a way to program (proto-)threaded actions on the ethersex in an
relative simple "language", which may remember some people in basic. The
6Control scripts are a big m4 construct, which translates the 6control source
into normal C code, which is compiled into the firmware image. So 6control has
no support for reloading modules in the running system.

With 6control you can react on external events, like io changes, the system
clock is at a certain value or a timer has expired. The reaction to such an
event is an ACTION. Every action is a seperate proto thread. So if you start
a proto thread it doesn't lock the whole system. You can also start several
proto threads at once, which seems to run at the same time.

!! How do i write an 6control script

Every 6control scipt must be started with `CONTROL_START' and ended with
`CONTROL_END'. Within this body you can define various actions, which are
started with ACTION($action_name) and ended with ACTION_END($action_name),
here the $action_name must be replaced with a unique action identifier.

Inside the action "tags" you add the code for the specific action. Outside of
all actions you can write down, how the 6control script should react on
events. For example this piece of code, which is placed outside of all
actions ( for this example you must enable clock support in your ethersex
firmware )

ON CLOCK_MIN == 5 DO ACTION_START(nice_action) END

Here you see how to write such an event handler, this starts the action
`nice_action', if the minute field of the time is exactly 5 (e.g. 05:05 or
23:05). But be aware of the ACTION_START command. This starts the action only
if it isn't started already. So this piece of code starts the action only the
first time after startup ( if the action isn't stopped somewhere with
ACTION_STOP). There ist also the possibility to use ACTION_RESTART, which
starts the action always new, when ACTION_RESTART is called. 

!! An example of 6control

An simple example, which may show you some features of 6control:

CONTROL_START
  
  PIN_INPUT(KEY)
  PIN_PULLUP(KEY)
  PIN_OUTPUT(LED)

  ACTION(nice_action)
      TIMER_START(new)
      PIN_SET(LED);
      TIMER_WAIT(new, 20)
      PIN_CLEAR(LED);
  ACTION_END(nice_action)

  ON CLOCK_MIN == 5 DO ACTION_RESTART(nice_action) END
  ON PIN_FALLING(KEY) DO ACTION_RESTART(nice_action) END

CONTROL_END

* The typical CONTROL_START, CONTROL_END enclose the 6control scripts
* the pin commands:
** the names PIN_INPUT and the other PIN_* refers to are the same, which are
   defined in pinning/*.m4. You also may to add your pins there.
** PIN_INPUT defines the KEY pin as an input pin (DDRx is set correctly)
** PIN_PULLUP enabled the pullup for the KEY pin (PORTx is set correctly)
** PIN_OUTPUT defines the LED pin as an output pin (DDRx is set correctly)
** PIN_FALLING(KEY) is an event, which is always triggered if there is an
falling edge on the pin KEY. Corresponding to PIN_FALLING, PIN_RISING does
also exists.

* ACTION, ACTION_END define a new action `nice_action' within this action
  there is a timer started ( the first call of TIMER_START creates this timer
  also, the creation of a timer can also be done with TIMER_NEW). After the
  timer is started the LED key is enabled. 
* The TIMER_WAIT waits, until the created timer has reaced 20 seconds. After
  that the LED is cleared again. Be aware of the ; at the end of PIN_SET,
  PIN_CLEAR. This is because this lines are not interpreted with m4, but are
  plain C code (CPP macros)
* The two ON commands start the action nice_action either when the clock
  minute field is 5 ( be aware of the RESTART ) or the KEY pin has an falling
  edge.
